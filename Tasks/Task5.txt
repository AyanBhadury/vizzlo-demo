TASK 5 

There would be two components involved 

1 - Server which will be associated with exporting the charts when requested. 
The tech stack I would go for would be any server side language lets assume it would 
be node js, since it will have chromium (headless browser) which will be automated using pupeteer.

2 - The SDK which will interact with server end points and will export the chart.
The SDK could be also implemented in mutiple tech stack, java,python,node

PROS : 
The export could be rendered at the server side, which means it may not be required to render
the chart at the browser at all, we can also include a CRON job which will do the task at
weekly or monthly basis.

It will be able to handle large number of request at a time, also the end user will have the 
flexibility to host into any cloud services and also implement a load balancer if needed.

Can also be created a  docker container out of it.

CONS : 
Server build files may be need for each different opearting system, for example
windows, linux etc
Since the server will be running for a longer state proper management of physical space 
need to be taken care of.
